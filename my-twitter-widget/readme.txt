== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have tried many widgets found for Wordpress and they all lack something. What makes this one differnet? =

* Well we tried to keep the entire widget as simple as possible yet still provide you with options. The number one item most people complain about is how the widget looks on their site compared to the rest of their site. It either looks like a big sore thumb on their site or the way the twitter feeds are formated look horrible and sloopy. Wetried to resolve this problem by providing options for the css of the widget. You have several options you can choose from without any css knowledge and if none of those work you can override the css using the css field to style the widget to look in uniform with your site.

= Sometimes my feeds stop working =

*Often times twitter is updating their system, and the feeds will dispaer from time to time. If there do not return after several hours then you can contact us and we will look into the problem.

= I have changed twitter usernames, but its still showing my old account feeds =

* You need to clean the cache of the browser you are using or your wordpress site. The widget is designed to cashe the feeds to provide a quicker more real time display as you tweet, therefore it will tell your browser to store and use the same data. If after clearing the cache from both your website and brower you still experience problems please contact us.
